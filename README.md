# Survery Data Analysis

I converted data I received from my family's fantasy football team name competition survey from Survey Monkey. You can compare two teams to see which one the participants thought was a better team name.

# How to use it:

1. Select a team name in each dropdown menu
2. Click "Compare the Teams" button
3. Scroll down to see how they compare
